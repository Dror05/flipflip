        <h2 id="1scenes">1. Scenes</h2>

        <p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the main component of FlipFlip. Each Scene consists of collection of slideshow settings: which images to show, what timing to use, what effects, and more.</p>

        <p>To create a Scene, click "+ Add Scene" (1). You will be brought to the Scene Detail page. </p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/scene_details.png" alt="" />
            When you return to the Home page, you will see your new scene in the list of Scenes (4).</p>

        <h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

        <p>The most important part of any Scene is its <strong>Sources</strong>. This is simply a list of all the places FlipFlip will find images to show. FlipFlip supports sources from (1) Local Directories, (2) A text document with a list of image URLs, or (3) one of the <a href="#currently-supported-remote-sources">currently supported remote sources</a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Sources can be ordered Alphabetically (either their full URL or their parsed name), by Date Added, or by Type.</li>

            <li>Sources can also be manually ordered by drag'n'dropping them.</li>

            <li>To edit a source, click the <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/pencil.svg" alt="Edit" width="20" height="20"> and then make your desired changes. <em>Note: Blank and duplicate sources will be automatically removed</em></li>

            <li>To clear the cache for a source, click the <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/clean.svg" alt="Clear cache" width="20" height="20"></li>

            <li>To delete a source, click the <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/delete.svg" alt="Remove" width="20" height="20"></li>

            <li>To clear <em>all</em> sources in a scene, click "- Remove All" and confirm.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For information about adding from the Library, see the <a href="#importing-library-sources-in-scene">Library section</a> section below. For information about exporting/importing a Scene, see the <a href="#8-exportimport-library-and-scenes">Export/Import</a> section below.</p>

        <h4 id="localdirectory">Local Directory</h4>

        <p>The simplest way to use FlipFlip is to click "+ Add local files" and pick a directory on your computer that contains images. FlipFlip will search the entire directory, including subfolders.</p>

        <h4 id="imagelist">Image List</h4>

        <p>If you want to load specific images from the web, you can create a text file containing one URL per line, like this:</p>

        <pre><code>https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*vnYtP9N80SQ0pOOD.png
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*P1UL5C8Lkyq7wd5P.png
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*vnYtP9N80SQ0pOOD.png
</code></pre>

        <p>Then you can either save that file to your computer, or uploaded it to a text file hosting service like <a href="https://hastebin.com">Hastebin</a> if you want to share it with others.</p>

        <p>Once you've created this file, click "+ Add URL". Simply type or paste the path to your text file (remote or local).</p>

        <p>Due to high traffic, Tumblr throttles FlipFlip's use. A number of keys have been provided, but we recommend configuring your own for seamless use. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Login to Tumblr</li>

            <li>Go to https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps</li>

            <li>Click "+ Register Application"


                <ul>
                    <li>Application Name: <strong>FlipFlip</strong></li>

                    <li>Application Website: <strong>https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip</strong></li>

                    <li>Application Description: <strong>FlipFlip</strong></li>

                    <li>Default callback URL: <strong>https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip</strong></li></ul>

            <li>Return to FlipFlip and click "Authorize FlipFlip on Tumblr"</li>

            <li>Click "Allow" when the prompt appears in your browser</li>

            <li>Return to FlipFlip and you should see a confirmation!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="secretgooninatorimport">Secret: Gooninator Import</h4>

        <p>If you have some saved links from the beloved, retired web app Gooninator, you can import them into FlipFlip either as Tumblr blogs (as they were before) or as local directories (to use your backups).</p>

        <p>To access this tool, click in the "Sources" area and then press <strong>Alt+P</strong>. You should then see a popup appear. Paste the Gooninator URL, and select whether you'd like to import these sources as Tumblr blogs or Local directories. If you choose to import as local directories, you must also configure the directory where you kept your blog backups.</p>

        <h3 id="playingyourscene">Playing Your Scene</h3>

        <p>After you have added at least 1 source and configured your chosen effects, click the "Play" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/play.svg" alt="Play" width="20" height="20"> ) to start the show!</p>

        <h4 id="sceneloading">Scene Loading</h4>

        <p>While a Scene (or its overlay) is loading, a progress indicator will display showing the current source being loaded and the progress so far. If a Scene finishes loading before its overlay, you will see a separate overlay loading indicator as well. When both the Scene and overlay have loaded, the slideshow will begin. To avoid lag and janky playback, it's recommended to let loading finish, but if you want to start early anyway, click "Start Now" when it appears.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/scene_loading.png" alt="" /></p>

        <h4 id="playbackcontrols">Playback Controls</h4>

        <p>All scene options (except the image filter) can also be changed while playing a slideshow by hovering over the sidebar on the left.</p>

        <h4 id="imageinfo">Image Info</h4>

        <p>While a Scene is playing, you can right click on an image to get more information about it. The image's source and individual URL are always shown (click to copy to the clipboard). You can also choose to open the source or image directly (will use your system's default app for opening that type of link). If the URL is for a local file, you are given options to view it in Explorer/Finder or delete it from the system (handy for pruning images you don't want in FlipFlip). If it is for a remote file and you have enabled caching, a link to the caching directory is also provided.</p>

        <h2 id="2library">2. Library</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Library</strong> is a place for you to collect and manage all your sources. If you had previously used FlipFlip before v2.0, the Library will be automatically populated with all your Scenes' sources.
            To access the Library just click "Library" (2) on the home page.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/library.png" alt="" /></p>

        <h3 id="addingsources">Adding Sources</h3>

        <p>Sources are added to the Library and sorted just like in <a href="#sources">a Scene</a>. </p>

        <h3 id="taggingsources">Tagging Sources</h3>

        <p>The main power behind the Library (and driving force of <a href="#3-scene-generators">Scene Generators</a>) is the tagging system.</p>

        <p>The first step is to add some tags. Click the "Manage Tags" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/tag.svg" alt="Manage Tags" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top right.</p>

        <h4 id="managetags">Manage Tags</h4>

        <p>From this screen, we can add, remove, and re-order our tags.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To add a new tag click "+ Add" and then type the name of the tag</li>

            <li>To edit a tag, click on the tag and edit the name</li>

            <li>To remove tags, click "- Remove Tags" and click the tags you wish to delete. When done click "Done" or "Back"</li>

            <li>To manually re-order tags, simply drag'n'drop them. (This is the order which they will appear everywhere else)</li>

            <li>When you are done managing tags, click "Apply" or "OK" to save your changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/manage_tags.png" alt="" /></p>

        <h4 id="taggingasource">Tagging a Source</h4>

        <p>To tag a source in the Library, click the name of the source. This will start a Scene with just that source. To modify the tags, hover towards the bottom of the screen and you will see your tags appear. Toggle tags on/off as desired by clicking on them. When you're done, click "Back" to return to the Library.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/tagging.png" alt="" /></p>

        <h4 id="batchtagging">Batch Tagging</h4>

        <p>To begin batch tagging, click the "Batch Tag" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/batch.svg" alt="Batch Tag" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top right. This will provide a checkbox next to each visible source. Select the sources you would like to batch tag and click "Batch Tag Selection". You will be presented with a pop-up and a number of options.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Select tags and click "Overwrite" to force each selected scene to match those tags</li>

            <li>Select tags and click "- Remove" to remove those tags from each selected scene.</li>

            <li>Select tags and click "+ Add" to add those tags to each selected scene.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="searchfilter">Search/Filter</h4>

        <p>Use the search bar to help find or filter the displayed sources. Tags appear with a number indicating how many of the displayed sources have that tag.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Click on the search bar and select a tag, <code>&lt;Offline&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;Untagged&gt;</code>.


                <ul>
                    <li>Start typing to find a particular tag.</li>

                    <li><code>&lt;Offline&gt;</code> shows only sources that have been determined to be offline by <a href="#mark-offline">Mark Offline</a>.</li>

                    <li><code>&lt;Untagged&gt;</code> shows only sources which have no tags.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li>Type any term and press "Enter" or "Search for <code>&lt;&gt;</code>" to search. This is not case sensitive.</li>

            <li>Type "-" and then any term or filter to <em>exclude</em> those sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="markoffline">Mark Offline</h4>

        <p>As your Library grows, it's possible some sources will become unavailable. To aid in detecting this, click the "Mark Offline" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/mark-offline.svg" alt="Mark Offline" width="20" height="20"> ) to check your sources. When this process completes, unavailable sources will be marked in red.</p>

        <h4 id="marksources">Mark Sources</h4>

        <p>Users may wish to visually highlight certain items. To do this, search/filter the displayed sources until they are the ones you wish to highlight, and then press <strong>Alt+M</strong>. These sources will be colored green and will remain that way after the search/filter is cleared. This may be useful for keeping track of a set of sources you are working on (for instance new sources you are tagging).</p>

        <h3 id="importinglibrarysourcesinscene">Importing Library Sources in Scene</h3>

        <p>To import Library sources into a Scene click the "+ Add From Library" button from the scene detail page. This will bring you to a view of your Library with checkboxes next to each source. You can filter and sort this list to assist with locating sources. After you are done selecting the sources you want, click "Import Selected". Your selected sources will now appear in the scene.</p>

        <h2 id="3scenegenerators">3. Scene Generators</h2>

        <p><strong>Scene Generators</strong> are a special kind of Scene that uses weighted tags and scenes to generate a randomly selected list of sources from the Library.</p>

        <p>Once you have at least 1 Scene <em>or</em> at least 1 source and 1 tag in the Library, you can click "+ Add Scene Generator" on the Home page to make a new Generator.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/generator.gif" alt="" /></p>

        <p>When you return to the Home page, you will see your new Generator in the list of Scenes (4), however, Generators are distinguished with a <strong>bold</strong> border (5).</p>

        <h3 id="weighting">Weighting</h3>

        <p>Tags can be weighted in 1 of 3 ways:</p>

        <h4 id="weight">Weight</h4>

        <p>This will be the most commonly used option. The weight value (modified with the slider) acts as a ratio for each tag in relation to other tag weights. <em>Weight is <strong>not</strong> the same as percentage</em>. The calculated percentage is shown next to the weight to help make results clear.</p>

        <p>For example, if 3 tags each have weight 1, the ratio would be <code>1:1:1</code> or ~33% each. This would be <em>the same</em> as if they were all weighted as 50 (i.e. <code>50:50:50</code> == <code>1:1:1</code>).</p>

        <h4 id="require">Require</h4>

        <p>This weight means that all sources <em>must have</em> this tag.</p>

        <h4 id="exclude">Exclude</h4>

        <p>This weight means that all sources <em>must <strong>not</strong> have</em> this tag.</p>

        <h4 id="scenes">Scenes</h4>

        <p>Scenes can <em>only</em> be weighted (not required/excluded). Other required/excluded tags have no effect on sources from scenes.</p>

        <h3 id="generatescene">Generate Scene</h3>

        <p>Once you have weighted each tag/scene to your preference, click "Generate Scene". This will use the tag &amp; scene weights you set up to generate a random selection of sources for your Scene. The default max number of sources is 200, but you can lower or raise this to meet your needs.</p>

        <p>Any changes to Timing/Effects/etc. here will be persisted between generated Scenes (using this Generator). The only thing that gets overridden when you click "Generate Scene" is the list of sources. If you are particularly fond of a generated Scene, you can click "Save as New Scene" to save these sources as their own stand-alone Scene.</p>

        <p>Once you have generated a Scene, you can click the "Previous Scene" button on the tag weights screen to go back to the last Scene generated (and not generate new sources).</p>

        <h2 id="8exportimportlibraryandscenes">8. Export/Import Library and Scenes</h2>

        <p>FlipFlip makes it easy to share your Library or Scenes with others!</p>

        <h3 id="export">Export</h3>

        <p>Users may wish to export their Library to share with others. To do this, click the "Export" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/export.svg" alt="Export" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top Left of the Library. Simply save the json file and share it as you'd like, or keep it as a backup. This file is just a long line of text which holds the data about your Scene's configuration. You can also just post this text online for someone to import with (you don't have to share the file directly).</p>

        <p>To export a Scene, click the Scene you want to export and click the "Export Scene" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/export.svg" alt="Export" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top left. Save the file and share just like the Library.</p>

        <p>NOTE: <em>Due to the nature of FlipFlip scenes, we don't recommend you try and export/import Scenes with local directories. This will technically work, but the exporter/importer would have to have the same file paths (or will have to modify them manually). In addition, any exported Generators will be imported as regular Scenes.</em></p>

        <h3 id="import">Import</h3>

        <p>To Import a Library, click the "Import" button ( <img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/src/renderer/icons/import.svg" alt="Import" width="20" height="20"> ) and select the library .json file you'd like to import. Sources you already have will not be duplicated. However, if the imported Library has tags for that source and you do not, the tags will be imported. The tags for any new items will be created and added.</p>

        <p>To import as Scene, click the Import arrow (8) on the Home page. You will be prompted to select a file to import from. If you have a <code>.json</code> export file, simply select it and your Scene will import. If you got a line of text from someone, paste it into a file and save it. Then pick that file during the import.</p>

        <h2 id="9flipflipconfig">9. FlipFlip Config</h2>

        <p>FlipFlip allows you to configure default Scene effects and more! To access the Config page, click the little gear icon (9) on the Home page.</p>

        <p>When you are done making changes to the Config, click "Apply" or "OK". Settings will only be saved if they are valid.</p>

        <p><img src="https://github.com/ififfy/flipflip/raw/master/doc_images/v2.2/config.png" alt="" /></p>

        <h3 id="scenedefaults">Scene Defaults</h3>

        <p>Configure default settings for each Scene just like you would in the Scene itself. These preferences will be applied whenever you create a new Scene (or Generator).</p>

        <h3 id="playersettings">Player Settings</h3>

        <p>These scenes control various player options. Min Image/Video Size is the minimum number of pixels each dimension of an image/video must be (default: 200 - image must be larger than 200x200). Max in Memory is the maximum number of images to queue up for rendering. Max in History is the maximum number of images to keep in history (navigating backwards and forwards). Both of these lists are cleared when the slideshow is stopped. Be cautious increasing the Max Loading at Once as this will degrade performance. Likewise, lowering this number may improve performance.</p>

        <h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

        <p>These settings control the caching abilities of FlipFlip. By default, FlipFlip caches 500MB of images in the <code>appData</code> directory. However, you can customize the caching dir and max size by changing values here. Turning caching off will prevent FlipFlip from reading from or writing to the cache.</p>

        <h3 id="apikeys">API Keys</h3>

        <p>These settings control how remote sources are used.</p>

        <h4 id="tumblr">Tumblr</h4>

        <p>By default, Tumblr API keys are provided. However, if you are experiencing 429 responses from Tumblr, you may replace these with your own API keys to improve performance.</p>
