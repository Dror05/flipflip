# Importing Audio Library Tracks in Scene
To import Audio Library tracks into a Scene, first make a new playlist from the Audio Card, and then click the `+` and 
to add a track to that playlist. This will bring you to a view of your Library with checkboxes next to each track. You 
can filter and sort this list to assist with locating sources. After you're done selecting the sources you want, click 
the `Import` button ( <img style="vertical-align: -5px" src="doc_icons/import.svg" alt="Import" width="20" height="20"> ). 
Your selected tracks will now appear in the playlist. Tracks are added in the order they were selected.

?> **Tip**: Use the _SHIFT_ key to quickly select multiple sources
