## Audio
This card allows you to layer multiple audio tracks over your Scene. It also contains the audio controls for these tracks.
* **Tick** - The audio file will play/restart at a certain interval.
  * Control tick timing options.
* **Stop at End** - The Scene will stop when the audio track ends.
* **Speed** - Control the playback speed of this track.

FlipFlip will detect the BPM of the **first audio** file which can be used for timing the scene or effects.

?> There is no limit to the number of audios you can use, but you may experience poor performance if you use too many.

## Text
This card allows you to play a caption script over your Scene. Choose a text file that follows 
the [caption script format](caption_script.md). This can be a local file or a remote URL.

* **Stop at End** - The Scene will stop when the caption script ends.

?> By default, the font options are hidden. Click the **eye icon** to show/hide font options.
