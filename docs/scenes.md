# Scenes Overview

A **Scene** is the main component of FlipFlip. Each Scene consists of collection of slideshow settings: 
which images to show, what timing to use, what effects, and more.

To create a Scene, click `+ Add Scene` from the Home screen. This will bring you to the Scene Detail page. 
When you return to the Home page, you will see your new scene in the list of Scenes.
