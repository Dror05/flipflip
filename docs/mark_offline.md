# Mark Offline
As your Library grows, it's possible some sources will become unavailable. To aid in detecting this, click the 
`Mark Offline` button ( <img style="vertical-align: -5px" src="doc_icons/mark-offline.svg" alt="Mark Offline" 
width="20" height="20"> ) to check your sources. When this process completes, unavailable sources will be marked in red.
