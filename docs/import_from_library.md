# Importing Library Sources in Scene
To import Library sources into a Scene click the `+ Add From Library` button from the Scene Detail page. This will 
bring you to a view of your Library with checkboxes next to each source. You can filter and sort this list to assist 
with locating sources. After you're done selecting the sources you want, click `Import Selected`. Your selected 
sources will now appear in the scene.
