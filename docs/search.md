# Search/Filter
Use the search bar to help find or filter the displayed sources. Tags appear with a number indicating how many of the 
displayed sources have that tag.

* Click on the search bar and select a tag, `<Offline>`, or `<Untagged>`.
  * Start typing to find a particular tag.
  * `<Offline>` shows only sources that have been determined to be offline by [Mark Offline](mark_offline.md).
  * `<Untagged>` shows only sources which have no tags.
* Type any term and press "Enter" or "Search for ___" to search. This is not case sensitive.
* Type "-" and then any term or filter to _exclude_ those sources.
